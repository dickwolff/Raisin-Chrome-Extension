## What does it to?

Raisin returns your accrued interest in their response body. They do however not show it. This extension does! You can also add a name to your saving accounts. The extension utlilizes [chrome.storage.sync](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage?hl=nl#property-sync) to sync the names to your other devices.
